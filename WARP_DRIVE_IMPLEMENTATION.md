# Warp Drive Implementation Summary

**Course:** CS146S - The Modern Software Developer  
**Assignment:** Week 5 - Warp Drive Automations  
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Option:** A) Warp Drive saved prompts, rules, MCP servers

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive set of Warp Drive resources to streamline development workflows for the CS146S course repository. The resources include 4 saved prompts, 1 MCP server integration (GitHub), and supporting documentation.

## What Was Created

### 1. Saved Prompts (4)

All prompts follow best practices: focused workflows, argument passing, idempotency where applicable, and headless/non-interactive steps.

#### a. Test Runner (`test-runner.md`)
**Purpose:** Run tests with coverage analysis, flaky test detection, and actionable feedback.

**Features:**
- Pytest execution with verbose output and early failure detection
- Flaky test detection (re-runs failed tests to identify intermittent issues)
- Coverage analysis with <80% threshold alerts
- Specific fix suggestions ranked by confidence
- Identifies missing test coverage areas

**Example usage:**
```
Run tests for week4
Run tests for week5 test_notes.py::test_create_note
```

**Why it's useful:**
- Saves time debugging test failures with ranked fix suggestions
- Identifies flaky tests that might cause CI/CD issues
- Provides actionable coverage improvements

#### b. Docs Sync (`docs-sync.md`)
**Purpose:** Generate/update API documentation from OpenAPI spec and detect route deltas.

**Features:**
- Fetches OpenAPI spec from running server or generates it directly
- Compares with existing docs to detect new/changed/removed endpoints
- Generates comprehensive API.md with examples
- Preserves manual sections (authentication, rate limits)
- Route delta report (🆕 new, ⚠️ modified, ❌ removed endpoints)

**Example usage:**
```
Sync API docs for week4
```

**Why it's useful:**
- Keeps documentation in sync with code automatically
- Detects API drift (undocumented changes)
- Saves hours of manual documentation work

#### c. Refactor Harness (`refactor-harness.md`)
**Purpose:** Safely refactor modules, classes, or functions with automatic import updates.

**Features:**
- Pre-flight validation with affected files preview
- Creates backup branch automatically
- Updates all imports (absolute, relative, module, star imports)
- Runs linter and auto-fixes issues
- Runs full test suite for validation
- Automatic rollback on failure

**Example usage:**
```
Refactor extract to extraction in week4
Refactor ActionItem to Task in week5
```

**Why it's useful:**
- Makes refactoring safe with automatic rollback
- Eliminates manual import hunting across codebase
- Validates changes don't break functionality

#### d. Release Helper (`release-helper.md`)
**Purpose:** Prepare releases with version bumps, checks, changelog generation, and tagging.

**Features:**
- Validates repository state (clean tree, correct branch)
- Semantic versioning support (major/minor/patch)
- Comprehensive pre-release checks (tests, linting, coverage ≥80%)
- Auto-generates changelog from git commits (categorized by type)
- Updates version in all files (pyproject.toml, main.py)
- Creates commit and annotated Git tag
- Never auto-pushes (manual confirmation required)

**Example usage:**
```
Prepare release minor for week4
Prepare release 1.0.0 for week5
```

**Why it's useful:**
- Automates tedious release preparation steps
- Ensures all checks pass before release
- Generates professional changelogs automatically
- Follows semantic versioning conventions

### 2. MCP Server Integration (1)

#### GitHub MCP Server
**Setup files:**
- `git-mcp-config.json` - Configuration template
- `GIT_MCP_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

**What it enables:**
- 🌿 Create branches autonomously
- 💾 Commit changes with AI-generated messages
- 🔀 Manage pull requests (create, update, merge)
- 🏷️ Create and manage Git tags
- 📊 Query repository status
- 🔍 Search issues and PRs for context
- ✅ Check CI/CD status before merging

**Example workflows:**
```
Create a new branch called feature/add-pagination, implement pagination for the notes endpoint in week4, and commit the changes

Create a PR for my current branch with a description based on recent commits

What's the status of PR #45? Are there any failing checks?
```

**Integration with prompts:**
- Combine Test Runner + MCP → Auto-commit passing tests
- Combine Docs Sync + MCP → Auto-commit documentation updates
- Combine Refactor Harness + MCP → Create refactor branch automatically
- Combine Release Helper + MCP → Push releases and create GitHub releases

### 3. Supporting Documentation

#### a. Main README (`.warp/README.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Directory structure
- Quick start instructions
- Detailed prompt documentation
- MCP setup and usage
- Workflow scenarios (4 complete examples)
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting
- Security notes

#### b. WARP.md (Root)
Repository-specific guidance including:
- Environment setup
- Common commands
- Architecture patterns (FastAPI full-stack, LLM prompting, MCP server)
- Development workflows
- Code quality standards
- Week-specific notes
- Common pitfalls

#### c. Updated .gitignore
Added protection for MCP config files containing tokens:
```
.warp/mcp/*-config-with-token.json
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Idempotency
Where possible, workflows are idempotent (safe to run multiple times):
- ✅ Test Runner - Always produces same output for same code
- ✅ Docs Sync - Multiple runs produce identical docs
- ❌ Refactor Harness - Changes code structure (but safe with rollback)
- ❌ Release Helper - Creates commits/tags (but validates first)

### 2. Safety-First
All workflows prioritize safety:
- Pre-flight validation before making changes
- Automatic backups (branches, stashes)
- Comprehensive testing before committing
- Rollback procedures documented
- Never auto-pushes to remote

### 3. Headless/Non-Interactive
Workflows prefer automation over interaction:
- All prompts can run without user intervention
- Clear argument passing via template variables
- Deterministic behavior based on inputs
- Progress reporting instead of prompts

### 4. Focused Workflows
Each prompt does one thing well:
- Test Runner → Testing and coverage
- Docs Sync → Documentation management
- Refactor Harness → Safe refactoring
- Release Helper → Release preparation

## Repository Integration

### Tailored to CS146S Repository
All resources are specifically designed for this repository's structure:

**Week-based organization:**
```
week4/
├── backend/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   ├── routers/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── tests/
└── Makefile
```

**Common patterns:**
- FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Pytest for testing
- Black + Ruff for linting
- Poetry for dependency management
- SQLite databases in `data/`

**Repository-specific commands:**
- `make test`, `make run`, `make format`, `make lint`
- `PYTHONPATH=. pytest backend/tests`
- Week-specific paths and conventions

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Implementing a New Feature (TDD)
```
1. Create a new branch called feature/search-notes and add a search endpoint to week4
2. Run tests for week4 test_notes.py::test_search_notes
3. [Fix failures based on feedback]
4. Run tests for week4
5. Sync API docs for week4
6. Create a PR with description based on recent commits
```

### Scenario 2: Weekly Assignment Workflow
```
1. Start work on week5 assignment: create branch assignment-week5
2. [Implement features]
3. Run tests for week5
4. Sync API docs for week5
5. Create PR with title "Week 5 Assignment Submission"
```

### Scenario 3: Releasing a New Version
```
1. Run tests for week4
2. Sync API docs for week4
3. Prepare release minor for week4
4. [Review: git show v0.2.0]
5. [Push: git push origin main && git push origin v0.2.0]
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Prompt Structure
All prompts follow a consistent structure:
1. **Title and Description** - Clear purpose statement
2. **Usage Syntax** - Template with placeholders
3. **What It Does** - High-level step overview
4. **Detailed Steps** - Numbered, executable instructions
5. **Output Format** - Examples of success/failure/warning outputs
6. **Safety Guidelines** - What it won't do
7. **Idempotency** - Re-run safety
8. **Arguments** - Parameter documentation
9. **Examples** - Real usage examples

### MCP Configuration Format
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "GitHub": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [...],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Token Protection
- Template config file includes placeholder `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE`
- Real tokens should be stored separately (not committed)
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude token-containing configs
- Setup documentation emphasizes token security

### Safe Operations
- All prompts validate before executing
- No automatic force-pushes to remote
- Backup branches created before destructive operations
- Rollback procedures documented

## Testing and Validation

All resources were designed with testing in mind:

1. **Test Runner Validation:**
   - Handles passing tests (coverage report)
   - Handles failing tests (specific suggestions)
   - Detects flaky tests (re-run logic)
   - Coverage threshold enforcement

2. **Docs Sync Validation:**
   - OpenAPI spec parsing
   - Delta detection (new/changed/removed)
   - Documentation completeness checks

3. **Refactor Harness Validation:**
   - Pre-flight checks (file existence)
   - Post-refactor validation (tests + linting)
   - Rollback on failure

4. **Release Helper Validation:**
   - Repository state (clean tree, correct branch)
   - Pre-release checks (tests, lint, coverage)
   - Version number validation
