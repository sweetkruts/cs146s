- Review changes before pushing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Prompt not working?**
- Check syntax matches examples
- Verify correct directory
- Review WARP.md for context

**MCP issues?**
- Check Docker: `docker ps`
- View logs: `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/mcp && tail -f github.log`
- Restart server in Warp UI

**Tests failing?**
- Run `make test` directly
- Check PYTHONPATH
- Activate conda environment
